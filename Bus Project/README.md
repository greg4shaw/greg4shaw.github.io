# Real Time Bus Tracker Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 9

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to track the live movement of a bus operating in the Boston area.
The bus will be tracked every 15 seconds and the position will be updated.
This will be shown by the marker that is displayed on the map.

### Improvements

* There has been a change in the style of the Mapbox map
* A button has been added that will start the tracking when clicked.

## Installation (How to run)

Clone the files that are in the Real Time Bus tracker directory to your local machine.
Open a new tab in your browser window.
Drag and drop the mapanimation.js file onto the new tab.
The map will load an appear in your browser.
There will be a button that is listed as 'Start Live Bus Tracking'.
Click on the button for the marker to load and begin tracking the live bus.

## Roadmap of future improvements

* Track more than one bus at a time
* Include more descriptive markers for each bus
* Allow for different interval tracking for buses who travel longer distances
