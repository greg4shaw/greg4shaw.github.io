> MIT xPRO - Week 4

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to create a moving PacMan through the use of 4 images. The project also requires the PacMan to change direction when reaching the end of the screen.

### Features

* A beautiful looking yellow PacMan
* A thrilling journey across a screen
* The unending question of whether PacMan will turn before it is too late...

## Installation

None of that nonsense needed. Simply click on the pacman.html file and your mind will be blown.

## Usage

### Usage:
Having a rough day? Can't seem to see the positive side of things? Well you are in luck. Using this PacMan project may not only turn your day around, but quite possibly your life. Use it as often as you like. Hell, run it on various machines at the same time if you can. The more exposure to this amazing little yellow creature you expose yourself to, the more happiness you will generate in your life, and let's be honest here, there is no such thing as too much happiness.

### Expected outcomes:
Freedom. 
Unbridled happiness.
Unicorns.
